							<br>
							<b><i>Abstract:</i></b>
							<br>
							Solar power satellites are proposed as a source of energy for terrestrial use. Architectures suggested vary in orbit selection, means of wireless power transmission, and energy generation method; though most have focused on the combination of geosynchronous orbit, microwave wireless power transmission, and photovoltaics. Recent approaches emphasize highly modular schemes to exploit improved economies of scale inherent in mass production. A key element in many of these architectures is the sandwich module, which performs in its layers three functions: sunlight-to-DC conversion, DC-to-microwave conversion, and microwave radiation. A sandwich module prototyping and testing effort provided insight into how these layers are integrated to address thermal concerns, and offered possible avenues for implementation of the layers and the module as a whole given state-of-the-art efficiency and performance constraints. Matching of solar array characteristics with electronics performance at expected operating temperatures and under projected solar illumination levels proved critical. Because of the layer interdependence of parameters such as efficiency, output power level, and operating temperature, modeling expected performance of an actual hardware implementation is challenging. Accordingly, the ability to test an integrated sandwich module while maintaining access to the separate interfaces between layers, under space-like environmental and illumination conditions, was important in allowing for the determination of optimal operating points. These results may be generalized to modules employing similar architectures. Suggestions for future areas sandwich module research are delineated.<br><br>

							<b>Dr. Paul Jaffe</b> is an electronics engineer, researcher, and integration and testing section head at the Naval Center for Space Technology at the United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL).  In over 20 years at the NRL, he has worked on dozens of missions for NASA, the U.S. Department of Defense, and other sponsors, including SSULI, STEREO, TacSat-1, and TacSat-4.  He developed standards and lead spacecraft computer hardware development as part of the Department of Defense’s Operationally Responsive Space effort. Paul served as a coordinator of the NRL’s funded study of the military applications of Space-Based Solar Power, and as an editor of the study group’s final report.  He was the principal investigator for a four-year research effort involving the development and testing of modules for conversion of sunlight into microwaves. He received a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park and a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering at the Johns Hopkins University, graduating with honors.  He also earned a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park.<br><br>

							<h5><font color="#31B404"><b>Wireless Power Transfer: From Directional Power to Omni-directional Power</b></font></h5>
							<p align="justify"><b>Speaker: Ron Hui, Professor, Imperial College London and Hong Kong University</b>
							<br>
							<b><i>Abstract:</i></b>
							<br>
							In traditional wireless power transfer applications, wireless power is usually directed to the targeted loads placed in well-defined locations or regions.  The power flow is usually directional, meaning the wireless power is controlled to flow from the transmitter to the receiver in one direction. Recently, research in transmitting power wireless in all directions on the 2-D and 3-D planes has been addressed. Omni-directional wireless power transfer in the past has low energy efficiency. The speaker will describe a new way of achieving omni-directional wireless power in an efficient manner.
							In this presentation, a brief update of new techniques for directional wireless power transfer is firstly presented. Then various omni-directional wireless power transfer techniques reported in the literature and their limitations will be described. Then, the use of the “non-identical current control” for generating magnetic field in an omni-directional manner will be explained. This patent-pending technology can be used to wirelessly charged a multiple of loads placed anywhere in the proximity of the omni-directional wireless power transmitter. This omni-directional wireless power transfer technology has been successfully demonstrated in both 2-D and 3-D systems. Practical results and video demonstration will be presented. The successful implementation of 2-D and 3-D omni-directional power transfer will be illustrated in video demonstration.

							<b>Prof. Ron Hui</b> obtained his Ph.D degree at Imperial College London in 1987. He is currently Chair Professor of Power Electronics at both Imperial College London (ICL) and the University of Hong Kong (HKU). At HKU, he holds the Philip Wong Wilson Wong Endowed Professorship. He has published over 180 refereed journal papers. Over 55 of his patents have been adopted by industry. His inventions in planar wireless charging technology underpin key dimensions of “Qi”, the world’s first wireless power standard launched by the Wireless Power Consortium (comprising over 210 companies worldwide), with free-positioning and localized charging features. He was appointed IEEE Distinguished Lecturer by the IEEE Power Electronics Society twice. He received two IEEE Transactions Prize Paper Awards from the IEEE Power Electronics Society in 2009 and 2010. In 2010, he received the IEEE Rudolf Chope R&D Award from the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society and the Crompton Medal for Achievements in Power from the IET, UK. He is a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences & Engineering and is the recipient of the 2015 IEEE William E. Newell Power Electronics Award.</p>
